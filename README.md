# jetbrainsPractice
Repository of Jetbrains academy projects that I'm completing which I think are worth highlighting, each folder has a more specific project description. Will be updated as I complete more projects.

# Brief Contents:

Coffee Machine (WIP): attempts to emulate a working coffee machine. Mainly attempts to use enum and getters and setters alongside various static functions.

Phonebook (WIP): Currently loops through a directory to find the numbers of people named in a separate file. Will become more algorithm practice as time goes on.
