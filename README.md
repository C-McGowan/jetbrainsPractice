# jetbrainsPractice
Repository of Jetbrains academy projects that I'm completing, each folder has a more specific project description.

Brief Contents:

Coffee Machine: attempts to emulate a working coffee machine. Mainly attempts to use enum and getters and setters.

Phonebook: Currently loops through a directory to find names specified in another file. Mainly IO practice.
